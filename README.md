# angular-key-events - an experiment in implementing directives for key bindings

Quick and dirty key binding directives with incomplete tests.

Infrastructure courtesy of [angular-seed](https://github.com/angular/angular-seed/)

### Running unit tests

*Note* tests are currently only passing in Firefox, and one of them is failing =/

We recommend using [jasmine](http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/) and
[JsTestDriver](http://code.google.com/p/js-test-driver/) for your unit tests/specs, but you are free
to use whatever works for you.

Requires java and a local or remote browser.

* start `scripts/test-server.sh` (on windows: `scripts\test-server.bat`)
* navigate your browser to `http://localhost:9876/`
* click on one of the capture links (preferably the "strict" one)
* run `scripts/test.sh` (on windows: `scripts\test.bat`)
